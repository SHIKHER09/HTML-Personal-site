		<h3>Future Doore</h3>

		<p>The team members of our team are undergraduates with a computer science background. In our
			college, there is no reliable source to find information about research-related topics.
			Additionally, we found it hard to find the exact article we needed on any other platform we had
			access to. Moreover, we learned that many students are unfamiliar with how to start/get into the
			field of research. To tackle this situation, we created a web application called "Future-Door"
			which is an exclusive platform made only for people, who are interested in research, where it
			enables the user to help out getting connected with the trainer, particularly of their research field
			of interest. In this way, research trainees as well as mentors will get an actual path from where
			they can get connected. Our model also offers a one on one chat system for the mentors and
			mentees which will get enabled only when both mentor and mentee will get matched. Also it
			provides a pathway to all the people to access any research related information (all the published
			articles in any research fields, about the author of any article published and much more) on one
			platform. Also, this project allows users to connect globally with mentors and companies who
			hire research trainees all over the world via an open chat system, where they can ask about their
			queries, engage in open discussions in groups, and learn about new trends in the field of
			research. We have also offered a feed section in our model where user can share their views
			regarding any research.
